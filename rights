# Rights management file for Radicale - A simple calendar server
#
# The default path for this file is /etc/radicale/rights
# The path can be specified in the rights section of the configuration file
#
# Some examples are included in Radicale's documentation, see:
# http://radicale.org/rights/
#
# This file gives independant examples to help users write their own
# configuration files. Using these examples together in the same configuration
# file is meaningless.
#
# The first rule matching both user and collection patterns will be returned.

# This means all users starting with "admin" may read any collection
[admin]
user: admin.*
collection: .*
permission: r

# This means all users may read and write any collection starting with public.
# We do so by just not testing against the user string.
[public]
user: .*
collection: public(/.+)?
permission: rw

# A little more complex: give read access to users from a domain for all
# collections of all the users (ie. user@domain.tld can read domain/*).
[domain-wide-access]
user: .+@(.+)\..+
collection: {0}/.+
permission: r

# Allow authenticated user to read all collections
[allow-everyone-read]
user: .+
collection: .*
permission: r

# Give write access to owners
[owner-write]
user: .+
collection: %(login)s/.*
permission: w
